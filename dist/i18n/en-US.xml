		<key key="LabelBirthdayPromoTitle">Training Update</key>
		<key key="LabelBirthdayPromoMessage"><![CDATA[The current training plans A, B and C will be updated to affect the same skills for all player's positions.
Train A will change from Defense or Shooting training to Skill training, and will improve the player's two specific skills (the two first), decreasing stamina a little.
Train B will still be Fitness Training, and it will improve Speed and Stamina, decreasing Technique a little.
Train C will be Strategic Training, and it will improve Passing, Dribbling and Technique, decreasing Speed and Stamina a little.
This update's goal is to simplify understading and planning for the training routines. Knowing how A, B or C works, you know how it affects ant player.
Following this update, soon it will be possible to choose your training routine (e.g: AABB, ABCA, AAAA) for more than 1 player at a time. You will be able to train your whole team at once.]]></key>

It is with a heavy heart that I come forward to announce my retirement as a football player.

But, in case you decide that it is in the team's best interest to start training a replacement for me and that I should be sold to another team, it's ok; all for the best of @3.
I would also like to thank you for the opportunity of defending your colors and for being a part of this great team.

We are making these changes in order to rebalance the game's economy after the end of our partnership with CLEAR and to reestablish the ammount of free credits distributed in the game, which is way too high.

		<key key="LabelIntensiveTrainingTitle">Intensive Training and morale tips</key>
		<key key="LabelIntensiveTrainingMessage"><![CDATA[Now you can finish your player's training and start a new one, if you need him to evolve faster.
But beware, each intensive training tires your player and his morale will go down by 5 points. Morale affects performance, so recover your morale or win competition matches to recover you lineup morale.
It's 15 credits to allow a new training whenever you want.
And did you know that morale can boost or hinder your player's performance? 100 morale can boost your player skills in up to 15%. For example:
80 Pass with 100 morale = 80 + 15% = 92 Pass. With 90 morale, it'd be 88 Pass, and with 70 morale, player gets his base skill, 80. If it's lower then 70, he starts to perform worse.
Manage your morale and use itens to maintain your team's performance.]]></key>

		<key key="LabelBetaSimulatorTitle">New match simulator</key>
		<key key="LabelBetaSimulatorMessage"><![CDATA[Starting July 17th, 15pm (GMT -3), the Beta match simulator will be the offical match simulator for all matches, for all competitions, friendlies and King of the Hill. 
We believe this version is superior then the current match simulator. What changed:
1) The stronger team, the one with more skill, adding all skills from all 11 starting players, has more advantage;
2) The home team get a little advantage, in competition matches. besides that, every 5000 more then the visitor team also give a little extra advantage.
3) Fullbacks are not as efficient as they were in intercepting the ball on shots to the goal. This is to discourage tactics with lots of fullbacks in front of the goal to prevent the ball to reach it;
4) Wingers now will try to go all the way to the goal line before crossing the ball
The Beta tournament will still remain active for a few days, and will be soon removed from the game.
We thank everyone who tried out the beta simulator on Beta Tournaments and playing King of The Hill, and also those who gave their feedback. This new version is the result of the feedback from several dedicated and experienced UFM managers.
We hope you enjoy the new match simulator for Ultimate Football Manager!]]></key>

• <b>How can i earn Credits?</b>
In Golaço there are many ways to earn credits:
	1. By accessing the game everyday. Each day you come to check out your team you will be given one credit, and if you play for 5 days in a row you will get an extra credit in the fifth day.</li>
	2. By winning League Matches. You get one credit every time your team wins a League match, provided that you have an active sponsor. League matches happen every day, so you have the chance of getting an extra credit every day.</li>
	3. Completing Facebook Offers through the 'Earn Credits' button in the top bar. Click and follow the instructions to begin winning credits.</li>
	
• <b>I have completed an offer and haven't been given any credits, what do i do?</b>
In case you haven't received credits after completing an offer, click <a src="https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=149756025094082">here</a> or follow these steps:
	• Return to the game where you accessed the promotion.
	• Click Earn Credits.
	• Click Help on the top right of the TrialPay Offer Wall.
	• Click See My Offer Status.
	• Click Report a problem next to the promotion you have problems with. Please note that the option to report a problem will appear 30 minutes after accessing the promotion, which should allow enough time for a transaction to be fully processed.
	• Please note, you will need to log in with Facebook if this is the first time you have contacted us through your game.
	• Note that you must access one of the promotions in order to submit a request. The TrialPay team will assist you with your promotion questions and concerns upon receiving your support request.
	
• <b>How do I make progress in the game? I have played my friendly matches and nothing happens!</b>
The progress in the game is determined by your results in the League and the other competitions; only competition matches generate income for your team. By finishing a League in the top 4 spots you will be promoted to the upper Series, creating a whole set of new options in the game.
	
• <b>Why do i always lose?</b>
If your team loses every match you either a problem with your attributes, your formation ou your players' morale. If your attributes are considerably lower than those of your opponent's, you will lose. Remember to always train your players and try to optimize your training routines in order not to leave important attributes unattended.
It is also possible that your formation is not good enough. Experiment with the players you have and try new things until you find the formation that fits best to your style, and don't forget to always check your opponent's formation, and try to find a way to beat it.
Regarding morale, the lower it is, the worse your players will perform. On each victory, the morale will rise, as it will lower on every defeat. If you want, you can give your players a morale boost in the Players screen, organizing retreats and such.
	
• <b>Why am I getting W.O.s?</b>
If you are losing matches by W.O. this means there is something wrong with your formation. It is possible that you have sold a starter player or that one of your starters has a red card ou a serious injury. Check out the Formation screen and make sure everything is in order. Take a look at the Players screen also, for more information on cards. Remember to always adjust your formation after selling a player, or after a player retires.
	
• <b>How do I earn money?</b>
There are two main income sources in Golaço: competition matches and sponsors. Sponsors will pay a fixed ammount every week, and may give you a bonus depending on your results in competitions. You only get money from sponsors in case you have an active contract. Regarding matches, the money you get is calculated based on the number of supporters you have and the capacity of the stadium where the match took place. The income is diferent whether you are the home or away team: the home team gets 80% of the available seats and the away team gets the other 20%. Since the match income is based on the ticket sales for your supporters you get more money on matches in your own stadium.

• <b>How do I get supporters?</b>
Each victory in competition matches will increase the number of supporters you have. Also, being promoted to a higher Series will greatly boost this number.
	
• <b>I haven't received from my sponsor!</b>
The sponsor payment occurs only on mondays, the same day your players receive their salaries.
	
• <b>Why am I not getting good results with my training routines anymore?</b>
As your players get better, it gets harder to make them improve. To optimize your training you should equip your Training Center with items in order to raise the attributes you need the most.
	
• <b>How do I raise my players' potential?</b>
A player's potential defines how good this player can get in his carreer, and it's the only attribute that cannot be trained or raised. Anyway, it's important to know that the higher a player's potential, the better the chances of him becoming a great player with proper training.
	
• <b>My match hasn't happened!</b>
Sometimes our servers can get overloaded and when that happens matches get delayed, and we apologize for that. In case this happens to you, we ask you to be patient and wait a few minutes, it is very likely that everything will go back to normal quickly. If something more serious has happened there will be a post in our FanPage about it, so be sure sure to check it before contacting the support team.
	
• <b>Why is there a team from another Series in my competition?</b>
As you know, the position in the League is what defines a team's series, and there are countless Leagues occuring simultaneously. When a League ends, the best and worst teams are automatically promoted and demoted, and with that it is possible that a team that is in the same competition as you change series in the middle of the competition. But since it's essentially the same team as before, there is nothing to worry about.
	
• <b>How do I know if my player has a red card? Will he be punished? How?</b>
The player management screen is the place to go in order to check cards information. There you can see a detailed list showing the cards for each individual competition. If your player has a red card in a competition he will have to serve a one match penaly in that competition, but can play normally in the others. Keep an eye on your cards to avoid W.O. situations.
	
• <b>What is the tie-break criteria in the competitions?</b>
Each competition works in a different way:
	• <b>League:</b> in the League, points are the main parameter. In case two teams have the same ammount of points, tie-break happens in the following order: number of victories, goals balance, goals scored and a sortition as last resort;
	• <b>Cup:</b> in the Cup what matters is the goals balance in the end of the two matches. Remember that goals are worth the same, whether you scored at home or at the adversary's stadium;
	• <b>Tournament:</b> the Tournament uses similiar criteria as the League in the group phase and as the Cup in the knockout phase.
	
• <b>Can I create a competition to play with my friends?</b>
Currently that is not possible. We have plans to create an editable competition which you will de able to create and invite your friends to play with you, but we are still not sure as to when this is going to happen.
	
• <b>Is there a way to change my team's name or the name of one of my players?</b>
The Configurations screen, accessible via the Office screen, offers you the option to change your team's name for a price. It is not possible to change players' names.
	
• <b>How can I sell a player?</b>
There are two ways to sell a player. You can do that directly via the player management screen, clicking the button to the left, or through the Auction House.
	
• <b>What is the best formation? What is the best way to train my players?</b>
There is no perfect formula to do well in Golaço, and there is no such thing as a flawless formation or a optimum training plan. Each trainer has his own formula, and they are all equally valid. Try and learn from your opponents and figure out what works best for your team.
	
• <b>I have a question that hasn't been answered here.</b>
If you have a question that has not been answered here, or found that one of our answers were not good enough, feel free to contact our support team through the Report Bug button in the top bar or in the My Team screen.
